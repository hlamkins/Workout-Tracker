## Overview
This is an application that allows you to add different workouts and then view your workout dashboard where all of the workout data is saved. The home page allows you to add workouts and also see your previously logged workout. 

## Requirements
Simply open the site on Heroku to access the application.

If using the code on your local computer you will need to run an npm install in order to download the dependencies and then view on your local server.
